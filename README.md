## Currently a work in progress

### Foundation
I'm using the docker image hosted at <a href="https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-beets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Linuxserver Beets</a>. It is my intension to borrow/steal as much as I can from <a href="https://github.com/florib779/beets-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener">florib799</a>. I orginally tried using his setup and modify out what I needed, but I quickly found out it was easier to start basic and add rather that hack through code and hope for the best.

The container is running on a VM with 32GB of drive space. At this time I don't know if I will keep everything local and move the files to where my Roon server can see it, or have it dump directly to the Roon server.
